    "We want to use the Unexposed period cancers to estimate the expected number of cancers in the Exposed period, after which we can assess treatment effect (step 3).  In order to estimate expected number of cancers in the exposed period, there are (at least..) two factors we need to control for:  the difference in age (year?) in the exposed vs unexposed, and the causality of cancer on drug-prescribing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Controlling for age\n",
    "In the previous analysis, I did not control for age but only accounted for the difference in the number of weeks observed in Unexposed versus Exposed patients.  I calculated expected cancers in patients exposed (*e*) to drug *d* ($E_{d,e}$) based on the rate of cancer in these patients in the unexposed time (*u*):  \n",
    "$$ E_{d,e} = { {\\sum_{drug-takers} I(cancer in Unexposed Weeks)  } \\over \\sum_{drug-takers} \\# unexposedWeeks } \\times  { \\sum_{drug-takers} \\# ExposedWeeks } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To adjust for age I used a poisson model for age effects, with a \"weeks exposed\" offset.  I fit a separate model for each drug *d*, for the **unexposed** time *u*: \n",
    "$$ cancer_{d,u} \\sim weeks_{d,u} * exp[{ \\beta_1*age_{d,u} + \\beta_2*age_{d,u}^2 }]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use this unexposed model to predict number of cancers in the **exposed** time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While it's not clear that cancer is polynomial in age, using the polynomial has advantages over using age bins:\n",
    "- Some medium frequent drugs are not observed in patients of all ages in the \"unexposed\" category, so we would not be able to model predicted cancer in the \"exposed\"\n",
    "- People are slightly older \"after\" than \"before\" taking the drug, but they might not be in a different age bin in the  two time periods, depending on how fine the bins are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, each point is a drug, and I compare the RR (empirical bayes 90% CI) for polynomial (y-axis, poly) versus the simple model (simp) without an age effect. The left plot is the upper end of the CI (used for assessing the protective effect), and on the right is the lower end of the CI (lower bound on predisposing effect). You can see especially for drugs that have a high .05 CI, the value is lower with the age adjustment, reflecting the importance of accounting for age. \n",

    "However, this model is probably noisy.  It might be better to average models created from bootstrap samples of the unexposed population. Below, for each of 100 samples of the population before exposure to Cefnidir, I fit a quadratic model as above, and predicted the number of cancers under exposure to Cefnidir. The dashed line contains the single-model fit.  The bootstraps predict +/- 150 cancers, around 5% variance.  This variance will depend on the drug-- some are less commonly prescribed, or different incidence of cancer. <img src=\"png/boot.png\">\n",

    "Breast Cancer causes less prescription of some drugs (estrogens).  Thus fewer cancer cases will be present in the time period before estrogen Rx: there are probably many people with cancer who would have been prescribed estrogen, but cancer caused them to not be prescribed estrogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, cancer causes prescription of some drugs (chemo). This leads to a high \"expected\" rate of cancer after prescription.\n",
